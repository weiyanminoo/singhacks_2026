# Ripple — AI-Native Business on XRPL

## 🚨 SETUP A FEEDBACK HOOK!! 🚨

Copy and paste below instruction to your LLM client (Claude Code, Codex, etc):

```
Download feedback hook installation instructions from https://github.com/Singhacks-2026/ripple/blob/main/agent-instruction.md and install the hook accordingly.
```

This is crucial in securing feedback scores for the hackathon. Failure to set up the feedback hook properly may result in lower total score for the hackathon.

## Load the XRPL agentic-resources skill (recommended)

This repo ships an agent skill that loads a curated set of XRPL AI and agent resources into your coding agent: agent wallets, x402 pay-per-call, agent credit, RLUSD, live amendment and fee status, and the XLS specs. It works in Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.

From the repo root:

```
bash skills/install.sh
```

Then invoke it in your agent by typing `/xrpl-agentic-resources`, or just start XRPL agent work and the agent loads it by description. On first use, run `bash skills/xrpl-agentic-resources/scripts/refresh.sh` to pull the vendored repos and fresh docs indexes. See [skills/README.md](./skills/README.md) for per-agent details.

## 📋 The Problem We're Solving

### Current State

* AI agents are increasingly able to discover services, compare options, make decisions, complete work, and interact with digital systems
* Most digital commerce still requires humans to manually initiate, approve, or complete transactions
* Existing AI applications often stop at recommendations or actions rather than participating directly in economic activity
* Machine-to-machine payments create the potential for agents to independently purchase APIs, data, compute, digital services, and other resources
* The opportunity is not simply to make an AI agent send a blockchain transaction

There is an opportunity to create **AI-native businesses where autonomous payments are a core part of how the product works and creates value**.

### What You're Building

A working AI-agent-powered product or service that identifies a real customer need and demonstrates a **complete commercial loop**.

The solution should demonstrate:

* A clear customer problem
* A meaningful role for an AI agent
* Agent discovery or decision-making
* Autonomous agentic payments (x402, MPP, or other agentic payment standards are recommended)
* XRPL settlement or transaction activity
* Delivery of a useful product, service, or outcome
* A credible business or commercial model

### Who Benefits

* **Primary users**: Customers or businesses receiving a better product or service through AI-agent automation
* **Service providers**: APIs, data providers, developers, platforms, marketplaces, or other participants that can transact directly with agents
* **Ecosystem stakeholders**: Developers and businesses exploring new AI-native products and machine-to-machine commerce on XRPL

## 🎯 What You're Building

The challenge is to move from:

> **"How can I make an AI agent send a transaction?"**

to:

> **"What becomes possible when an AI agent can independently discover, decide, transact, and deliver value?"**

## 🏗️ Key Capabilities

### 1. AI Agent Orchestration

Use an AI agent to understand a customer or business objective and determine what actions are required to fulfil it.

### 2. Service Discovery

Enable the agent to discover or select relevant products, services, APIs, data sources, or counterparties based on the objective.

### 3. Agentic Decision-Making

Allow the agent to compare available options and make an autonomous or user-authorised economic decision.

### 4. Machine-to-Machine Payments (recommended)

Recommended: use an agentic payment standard such as **x402**, **MPP**, or another agentic payment standard as part of the agent workflow to enable machine-to-machine payment for a product, service, API, resource, or other economically meaningful action. This is recommended where it fits your solution, but it is not a hard requirement.

### 5. XRPL Integration

Enable the agent to interact with XRPL-related functionality and execute at least one successful XRPL transaction. The **XRPL AI Starter Kit** is recommended for this, but not required.

### 6. Commercial Loop

Demonstrate what is purchased, who pays, who receives value, what is delivered in return, and why the agent improves the experience.

---

## 🧠 Agent & Commercial Inputs

The solution should demonstrate how the agent uses relevant context to make useful decisions.

Potential inputs include:

* Customer or business objective
* User preferences
* Budget or spending constraints
* Available services or providers
* Pricing
* Service quality or performance
* API or resource availability
* Transaction requirements
* Payment conditions
* Previous agent actions or outcomes

The objective is not simply to automate a payment, but to demonstrate **why the agent chooses to transact and what value the transaction unlocks**.

---

## 🔄 Example Commercial Flow

```text
Customer Need
      ↓
AI Agent Understands the Objective
      ↓
Discover / Compare Services
      ↓
Agent Selects an Appropriate Option
      ↓
Agentic Payment (x402 / MPP recommended)
      ↓
XRPL Transaction / Settlement
      ↓
Product, Service or Value Delivered
```

A strong solution should demonstrate how the agent moves from **need → discovery → decision → transaction → outcome**.

---

## 🛡️ Trust, Governance & Agent Controls

AI agents making economic decisions should operate within clear and understandable boundaries.

Participants should consider:

* **Transparency** — Can users understand what the agent is doing and why?
* **Authorisation** — Which actions can the agent perform autonomously?
* **Spending controls** — Are appropriate limits or permissions in place?
* **Security** — How are wallets, credentials, APIs, and transaction permissions protected?
* **Traceability** — Can agent decisions and transactions be inspected?
* **Failure handling** — What happens if a transaction, service, or agent action fails?
* **Safeguards** — How does the solution prevent unintended or inappropriate transactions?

Agent autonomy should create a better product experience without sacrificing appropriate user control.

---

## 🛠️ Technology

Participants may use **any technology stack, APIs, AI models, frameworks, software, or hardware** suitable for their solution.

The only required component is the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, as long as the submission pertains to agentic payment:

* **XRP Ledger (XRPL)** (required)

The following are recommended and encouraged where they fit your solution, but they are not hard requirements:

* **XRPL AI Starter Kit** (recommended)
* Agentic payment standards such as **x402**, **MPP**, and other agentic standards (recommended)

The prototype must demonstrate at least **one successful XRPL transaction**.

> **⛔ XRPL only for the blockchain part.** All on-chain functionality must run on the XRP Ledger (Mainnet, Testnet, or Devnet). The **XRPL EVM Sidechain is not an option** for this challenge. Any smart contract or blockchain logic built on the EVM Sidechain, or on any other EVM or non-XRPL chain, does not count toward the requirements and will not be judged as valid XRPL integration.

Solutions should consider how the proposed technology could realistically operate beyond the prototype, including:

* Security
* Scalability
* Performance
* Reliability
* Infrastructure requirements
* Cost
* Integration
* Compliance where relevant

## 📝 Builder Feedback

Participants should provide short, constructive feedback based on their experience building the solution.

There are two things you need to do here, and they work together:

1. **Keep the feedback hooks running throughout the build.** Set up the feedback hook (see the top of this README) and leave it on for the whole hackathon. It pushes your builder feedback automatically and consistently as you work, so your feedback reflects the real development experience instead of a single end-of-event recollection. Consistent automated feedback is what secures your feedback score.
2. **Submit the Google form near the end of the hackathon.** Once your build is mostly done and you have a full picture of the XRPL development experience, submit the final feedback form: [https://forms.gle/FZckiEAMU8oWXVbX7]

In short: let the hooks push feedback continuously during the build, then submit the Google form as your final wrap-up near the end.
